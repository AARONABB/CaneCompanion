Cane Companion: Your Smart Walking Stick

Problem: Many advanced mobility aids with features like obstacle detection, GPS navigation, and real-time feedback are expensive, often costing lakhs of rupees. This high cost limits access to these essential technologies for many individuals with visual impairments, particularly those with limited financial resources. As the accident rate from normal sticks is 88%.

Solution: Our solution is to create an attachment to the regular walking sticks for people with visual challenges to navigate and walk without accidents. This attachment will clip right onto their current walking stick and will also be available in various sizes. The smart attachment will have an  Ultrasonic sensor that can detect if danger is upon the user of the stick. For example, if the visually challenged user is trying to cross the road by themselves, a small buzzer will guide them through the road and tell them when to walk and when to stop. There will also be an emergency siren and call sensor that will contact the nearest medical center with an automated message telling them the address of the user and what happened in case the person is unconscious 



The **Smart Walking Stick for the Visually Impaired** is an innovative device designed to assist individuals with visual impairments by providing navigation aid and obstacle detection. Hereâ€™s a more detailed look at the project:
